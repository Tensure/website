        <p>The apprenticeship program at Tensure is a three-part, phased process that gives individuals with no prior experience the proper guidance and preparation to become proficient developers.</p>
        <p>We believe development is a skilled trade, and the mission of this program is to teach that trade to others. We ask that our apprentices rise to the occasion by making a commitment to the process and bringing a strong desire to change the trajectory of their career and life. If that sounds serious, wellâ€¦.it is. We take this program very seriously because it requires a lot of time and effort from everyone involved. We want to see our apprentices succeed with us and improve their life in the process.</p>
